NAME

_printf - A customized version of the standard library printf function. Designed for use at Holberton School.

SYNOPSIS

#include "main.h"

int _print(const char *format, ...)

DESCRIPTION

Our function _printf() sends an an output to stdout, the standard output
stream, depending on the format applied to the function in the function's
arguments. The format string controls the appearance of the output depending on one
or more directives that it includes. The function is a variadic function and as
such accepts a variable number of arguments to be displayed as long as there are
the equivalent amount of directives in the format string. The format string
contains characters that are directly output to stdout unless preceded by a %.
When a % is found in the format string the character following it specifies a
conversion that needs to be made according to the corresponding arguments which
follow the function's format string. The function successfully converts the
arguments that are characters, strings and the symbol %, when given as a
directive in the format string, a % followed by c, s, or % respectively.

EXAMPLES

_printf("this string will be printed!"\n)
